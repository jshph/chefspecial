Just deployed this to Firebase!
To try it out, visit https://chefspecial.firebaseapp.com/
Instructions:
- Click on Connect to SoundCloud
- Click a playlist. The script will search SoundCloud for relevant tracks. There is a dummy search by genre in place right now; search by tag is goal.
- Proceed to play the song in the widget. It should load the next track found in the initial search after this one finishes.
- While the track is playing, enter tags that you think fit and click submit. Tags are pushed to an external Firebase database.
